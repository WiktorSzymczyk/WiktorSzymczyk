**'Digital Craftsman (Developer/Designer/Upcoming Creator)'**

I'm a upcoming Full-Stack Web Developer aiming to land a job by Mid of 2023. Up until now I've been working on smaller personal projects and coding has been my favourite activity to do. Currently I am attending coding bootcamp with WBS Coding School. The staff and students are awesome and I feel like I can learn anything with any of the team members. All of my personal coding projects are built from the ground up, from planning and designing to development and usability testing. I love solving real-life problems through coding that can be supported by my project in Python that I did a while back that allows a user to sort their folder by the extension such as .mp4 or .txt.

    <summary><h3>✈️ Wiktor's Coding Journey</h3></summary>
    I started my coding journey in 2016. That was the year I came to United Kingdom and started attending Computer Science classes in Year 7. At the end of Year 8 I had an option of what subjects to choose for my GCSE courses. I have decided to roll with Computer Science classes disregarding my teachers comments that my English wasn't strong enough for this subject and I will struggle a lot. Since I didn't really taken that into heart and wanted to prove my teacher wrong I decided to roll with the subject and give it a go! I have to admit that it was a life changing decision and I'm glad that I have taken it as it allowed me to meet numbers of great people and get to know the insides of how computers work and what coding actually is. I have carried on with Computer Science for my A-Levels too achieving Grade B at the end of the Semester in 2022. After trying to get an apprenticeship and being declined many times within the 3 months I have decided to roll on with coding bootcamp that I'm attending now. I am living with a dream to become a Professional Web Developer in 2023, working for an amazing company. So let's see what the next months will bring!
